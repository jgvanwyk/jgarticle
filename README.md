# jgarticle

This is the LaTeX document class I use for typing my notes. It's essentially
the built-in article class, but with a couple of style overrides, a number of
useful math packages and various macros I've devised. I've put this here in
case anyone else finds any of this useful. I'll add a document explaining what everything does at some point.
