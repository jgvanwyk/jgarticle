# jgarticle

This is the LaTeX document class I use for typing my notes. It's essentially
the built-in article class, but with a couple of style overrides, a number of
useful math packages and various macros I've devised. I've put this here in
case anyone else finds any of this useful. I've annotated what everything does,
so nothing should be too arcane.
